## R packages

### rix: Reproducible Data Science environments with Nix

Simplifies the creation of reproducible data science environments using the
'Nix' package manager, as described in Dolstra (2006) <ISBN 90-393-4130-3>. The
included 'rix()' function generates a complete description of the environment as
a 'default.nix' file, which can then be built using â€™Nix'. This results in
project specific software environments with pinned versions of R, packages,
linked system dependencies, and other tools. Additional helpers make it easy to
run R code in 'Nix' software environments for testing and production.</p>

### rixpress: Build Reproducible Analytical Pipelines with Nix

<a href = "https://docs.ropensci.org/rixpress/"><img

Streamlines the creation of reproducible analytical pipelines using
'default.nix' expressions generated via the 'rix' package for reproducibility. Define
derivations in 'R', 'Python' or 'Julia', chain them into a composition of pure
functions and build the resulting pipeline using 'Nix' as the underlying
end-to-end build tool. Functions to plot the pipeline as a directed acyclic
graph are included, as well as functions to load and inspect intermediary results
for interactive analysis. User experience heavily inspired by the 'targets' package.</p>

### chronicler: Add Logging to Functions

<a href = "https://b-rodrigues.github.io/chronicler/"><img

inline; margin: 10px 50px 10px 10px; border-width: 0px;" width="180" /></a><p> 
Decorate functions to make them return enhanced output. The enhanced output consists in
an object of type 'chronicle' containing the result of the function applied to
its arguments, as well as a log detailing when the function was run, what were
its inputs, what were the errors (if the function failed to run) and other
useful information. Tools to handle decorated functions are included, such as a
forward pipe operator that makes chaining decorated functions possible.</p>

## Python packages

### ryxpress

[ryxpress](https://pypi.org/project/ryxpress/) is a Python reimplementation/port of 
the R package {rixpress}. It provides helpers and a small framework to build and 
work with reproducible, polyglot analytical pipelines that are built with Nix.

### talvez

[talvez](https://pypi.org/project/talvez/) is a lightweight Python implementation of 
a Maybe monad (Just / Nothing) inspired by the R package `{maybe}`.
