I'm currently employed as a statistician for the Ministry of Research and Higher
Education in Luxembourg. Before that I was senior data scientist and then
manager in the data science team at PwC Luxembourg, and before that I was a
research assistant at 
[STATEC Research](http://www.statistiques.public.lu/en/actors/statec/organisation/red/).

My hobbies are boxing, lifting weights, cycling, cooking and reading or
listening to audiobooks, which is more compatible with the life of a young
father. I started this blog to share my enthusiasm for statistics. My blog posts
are reshared on [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) and
[RWeekly](https://rweekly.org/). I also enjoy learning about the R programming
language and sharing my knowledge. That's why I made this blog and write
[ebooks](books.qmd). I also have a [youtube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTZXht1RTL2Duc3eU8MYGzQ), where I show
some tips and tricks with R, or rant about stuff.
