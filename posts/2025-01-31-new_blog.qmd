Happy new year! The blog has a new look! Well it's not that different on the
surface. But under the hood, it is quite different indeed!

My previous setup was: GitHub to host the code, on each push the build process
would get started on Netlify and then it would be hosted there. The engine was
Hugo.

This blog now still uses GitHub to host the code, but now also uses GitHub pages
for hosting and the engine is
[Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html).
The blog also gets built on GitHub Actions inside of a Nix environment: so I just
need to push and everything gets built!
[Here's the workflow that achieves this](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/blog/blob/master/.github/workflows/build_publish.yaml).

What's really amazing with Nix, is that I can preview my blog locally using
*exactly* the same environment as the one that will be used for building it on
GitHub actions. So if it *works on my machine* it's going to *work anywhere*.

You'll notice that the last step uses the
`rstats-on-nix/quarto-nix-actions/publish@main` action that is a fork of the
[quarto-dev/quarto-actions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions)
actions that just make them work inside of a Nix shell! This fork is hosted on the
`rstats-on-nix` organizations: I have a lot to say about this organizations, but
that's for a future blog post!

Migrating the pages was a rather long process, as I needed to make sure
everything was rendering correctly: because the folder structure of Quarto blogs
is different than the structure of Hugo blogs, I had to update many paths. This
was quite tedious and I didn't want to use a script for this as I also wanted to
take this opportunity to make some adjustments, such as centering images
properly and correcting some typos if I saw some. It was also quite interesting
to re-read some of my old blog posts.

One neat thing about Quarto is the possibility to use pre- and post-render scripts
that can be written in R. I'm using one to correctly sort the blog posts in the main
page, as for some reason they weren't being sorted properly.
[Here's the post-render script in question.](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/blog/blob/master/order_posts.R)

Now I can go back to working on [rix](https://docs.ropensci.org/rix/).
