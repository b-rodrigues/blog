This is a toy post demonstrating per-post Nix dependencies.

This post has a corresponding `2025-12-31-toy-post.nix` file that adds
the `purrr` package to the environment.

```{r}
library(purrr)

# Use purrr to demonstrate it's available
result <- map_dbl(1:5, ~ .x^2)
print(result)
```

The `purrr` package is not in the base `posts/default.nix`, but it's
available here because of the post-specific `.nix` file!
