<p>I am very happy to annouce that the <code>{chronicler}</code> package, which I’ve been working on for the past
3 months has been released on CRAN. Install it with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;chronicler&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><code>{chronicler}</code> allows you to create objects that carry a log
with them. Here is an example of an object that has been created using <code>{chronicler}</code>, and saved
using <code>saveRDS()</code> (which we now load back into our session using <code>readRDS()</code>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(chronicler)

my_df &lt;- readRDS(&quot;path/to/my_df.rds&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Printing <code>my_df</code> shows the following output:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>my_df</code></pre>
<pre><code>## OK! Value computed successfully:
## ---------------
## Just
## # A tibble: 9 × 3
## # Groups:   species [9]

## This is an object of type `chronicle`.
## Retrieve the value of this object with pick(.c, &quot;value&quot;).
## To read the log of this object, call read_log(.c).</code></pre>
<p><code>my_df</code> is made up of two parts, one is a data set, and the other is the log. If you wish
to know how this data set was created, you can call <code>read_log(my_df)</code> (this function will
be renamed to <code>read.log()</code> in the next release, to avoid clashing with <code>readr::read_log()</code>):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>read_log(my_df)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Complete log:&quot;

<p>if you want to get the dataset out of the <code>{chronicler}</code> “box”, you can do so with <code>pick(my_df, "value")</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pick(my_df, &quot;value&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 9 × 3
## # Groups:   species [9]
##   species    sex              mass

## 1 Clawdite   female           55  
## 2 Droid      none             69.8
## 3 Human      female           56.3
## 4 Hutt       hermaphroditic 1358  
## 5 Kaminoan   female          NaN

<p>To know more about all the package has to offer, read the
<a href="https://b-rodrigues.github.io/chronicler/">readme</a> and the
<a href="https://b-rodrigues.github.io/chronicler/articles/">vignettes</a> on the package’s website. I’m
already working on the next release, where I plan to add the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename <code>read_log()</code> to <code>read.log()</code></li>
<li>Make <code>{chronicler}</code> work with <code>{ggplot2}</code> (as described <a href="2022-05-15-self_doc_ggplot.qmd">here</a>)</li>
<li>Introduce functions to save <code>{chronicler}</code> objects as <code>.csv</code> or <code>.xlsx</code> files to disk (if the underlying value is a <code>data.frame</code>, as in the example above)</li>
<li>Anything else I think of between now and then!</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m really looking forward to see how people are going to use this package for their work,
personally I’ve been mixing <code>{chronicler}</code> with <code>{targets}</code> to build very robust pipelines to build
<code>chronicle</code> objects!</p>
