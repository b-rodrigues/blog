<p>Yesterday I wrote <a href="2018-04-14-playing_with_furrr.qmd">this blog post</a>
which showed how one could use <code>{furrr}</code> and <code>{mice}</code> to impute missing data in parallel, thus
speeding up the process tremendously.</p>
<p>To make using this snippet of code easier, I quickly cobbled together an experimental package
called <code>{pmice}</code> that you can install from Github:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;b-rodrigues/pmice&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>For now, it returns a list of <code>mids</code> objects and not a <code>mids</code> object like <code>mice::mice()</code> does,
but Iâ€™ll be working on it. Contributions welcome!</p>
