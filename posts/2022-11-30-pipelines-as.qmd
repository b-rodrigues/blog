<p>I’ve had some discussions online and in the real world about <a href="2022-11-16-open_source_repro.qmd">this blog post</a>
and I’d like to restate why containerization is needed for reproducibility, and do so from the
lens of functional programming.</p>
<p>When setting up a pipeline, wether you’re a functional programming enthusiast or not,
you’re aiming at setting it up in a way that this pipeline is the composition of (potentially)
many referentially transparent and pure functions.</p>
<p>As a reminder:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>referentially transparent functions are functions that always return the same output for
the same given input. So for example <code>f(x, y):=x+y</code> is referentially transparent, but <code>h(x):=x+y</code>
is not. Because <code>y</code> is not an input of <code>h</code>, <code>h</code> will look for <code>y</code> in the global environment.
Depending on the value of y, <code>h(1)</code> might equal 10 one day, but 100 the next.
Let’s say that <code>f(1, 10)</code> is always equal to 11. Because this is true, you could replace <code>f(1, 10)</code>
everywhere it appears with 11. But consider the following example of a function that is not referentially
transparent, <code>rnorm()</code>. Try <code>rnorm(1)</code> several times… It will always give a different result! This is because
<code>rnorm()</code> looks for the seed in the global environment and uses that to generate a random number.</p></li>
<li><p>pure functions are functions without side effects. So a function just does its thing, and does
not interact with anything else; doesn’t change anything in the global environment, doesn’t print
anything on screen, doesn’t write anything to disk. Basically, pure functions are functions that
do nothing else but computing stuff. Now this may seem limiting, and to some extent it is, so we will
need to relax this a bit: we’ll be ok with functions that output stuff, but only the very last function
in the pipeline will be allowed to do it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To be pure, a function needs to be referentially transparent.</p>
<p>Ok so now that we know what referentially transparent and pure functions are, let’s explain
why we want a pipeline to be a composition of such functions.
Function composition is an operation that takes two functions <em>g</em> and <em>f</em> and
returns a new function <em>h</em> such that <code>h(x) = g(f(x))</code>. Formally:</p>
<pre><code>h = g ∘ f such that h(x) = g(f(x))</code></pre>
<p><code>∘</code> is the composition operator. You can read <code>g ∘ f</code> as <em>g after f</em>. In R,
you can compose functions very easily, simply by using |&gt; or %&gt;%:</p>
<pre><code>h &lt;- f |&gt; g</code></pre>
<p><code>f |&gt; g</code> can be read as <em>f then g</em>, which is equivalent to <em>g after f</em> (ok, using <code>|&gt;</code> is chaining
rather than composing functions, but the net effect is the same).</p>
<p>So <code>h</code> would be our complete pipeline, which would be the composition, or chaining, of as many
functions as needed:</p>
<pre><code>h &lt;- a |&gt; b |&gt; c |&gt; d ... |&gt; z</code></pre>
<p>If all the functions are pure (and referentially transparent) then we’re assured that <code>h</code> will
always produce the same outputs for the same inputs. As stated above, <code>z</code> will be allowed to not
be pure an actually output something (like a rendered Quarto document) to disk. Ok so that’s great,
and all, but why does the title of this blog post say that containerization is needed?</p>
<p>The problem is that all the functions we use have “hidden” inputs, and are never truly
referentially transparent. These inputs are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version of R (or whatever programming language you’re using)</li>
<li>Versions of the packages you’re using</li>
<li>Operating system and its version (and all the different operating system dependencies that get used at run- or compile time)</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, let’s take a look at this function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>f &lt;- function(x){
  if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) x 
}</code></pre>
<p>which will return the following on R 4.1 (which was released on May 2021):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>f(1)</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>[1] 1
Warning message:
In if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1 :
  the condition has length &gt; 1 and only the first element will be used</code></pre>
<p>So a result 1 and a warning. On R 4.2.2 (the current version as of writing), the exact same
call returns:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Error in if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1 : the condition has length &gt; 1</code></pre>
<p>These types of breaking changes are rare in R, at least to my knowledge (I’m actually looking into
this in greater detail, 2023 will likely be the year I show my findings), but in this case it
illustrates my point: code that was behaving in a certain way started behaving in another way, even
though nothing changed. What changed was the version of R, even though the function itself was pure.
This wouldn’t be so surprising if instead of <code>f(x)</code>, the function was something like <code>f(x, r_version)</code>.
In this case, the calls above would be something like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>f(1, r_version = &quot;4.1&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>and this would always return:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>[1] 1
Warning message:
In if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1 :
  the condition has length &gt; 1 and only the first element will be used</code></pre>
<p>but changing the call to this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>f(1, r_version = &quot;4.2.2&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>would return the error:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Error in if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1 : the condition has length &gt; 1</code></pre>
<p>regardless of the version of R we’re running, so our function would be referentially transparent.</p>
<p>Alas, this is not possible, at least not like this.</p>
<p>Hence why tools like Docker, Podman (a Docker alternative) or Guix (which I learned about recently
but never used, yet, and as far as I know, not a containerization solution, but a solution actually
based on functional programming) are crucial to ensure that your pipeline is truly reproducible.
Basically, using Docker you turn the hidden inputs defined before (versions of tools and OS)
explicit. Take a look at this Dockerfile:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>FROM rocker/r-ver:4.1.0

RUN R -e &quot;f &lt;- function(x){if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) x};f(1)&quot;

CMD [&quot;R&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>here’s what happens when you build it:</p>

<p>as you can read from above, this starts the container with R version 4.1.0 and runs the code
in it. We get back our result with the warning (it should be noted that in practice, you would
structure your Dockerfile differently for running an actual pipeline).</p>
<p>This Dockerfile starts by using rocker/r-ver:4.1 as a basis. You can find this
image in the <a href="https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker-versioned2/blob/master/dockerfiles/r-ver_4.1.0.Dockerfile">versioned</a>
repository from the Rocker Project. This base image starts off from Ubuntu Focal Fossa
so (Ubuntu version 20.04), uses R version 4.1.0 and even uses frozen CRAN repository as
of 2021-08-09. It then runs our pipeline (or in this case, our simple function) in this, fixed
environment. Our function essentially became <code>f(x, os_version, r_version, packages_version)</code> instead of
just <code>f(x)</code>. By changing the first statement of the Dockerfile:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>FROM rocker/r-ver:4.1.0</code></pre>
<p>to this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>FROM rocker/r-ver:3.5.0</code></pre>
<p>we can even do some archaeology and run the pipeline on R version 3.5.0! This has great potential
and hopefully one day Docker or similar solution will become just another tool in scientists/analysts
toolbox.</p>
<p>If you want to start using Docker for your projects, I’ve written this
