The book I've been working on these pasts months (you can read about it [here](2016/11/04/ive-started-writing-a-book-functional-programming-and-unit-testing-for-data-munging-with-r.qmd), and read it for free [here](http://www.brodrigues.co/fput)) is now available on Leanpub! You can grab a copy and read it on your ebook reader or on your computer, and what's even better is that it is available for free (but you can also decide to buy it if you really like it). Here is the link on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/fput).

In the book, I show you the basics of functional programming, unit testing and package development for the R programming language. The end goal is to make your data tidy in a reproducible way!

Just a heads up: as the book is right now, the formatting is not perfect and images are missing. This is because I use `bookdown` to write the book and convert it to Leanpub's markdown flavour is not trivial. I will find a solution to automate the conversion from `bookdown`'s version to Leanpub's markdown and try to keep both versions in sync. Of course, once the book will be finished, the version on Leanpub and on my [website](http://www.brodrigues.co/fput) are going to be completely identical. If you want to read it on your computer offline, you can also download a pdf from the book's website, by clicking on the pdf icon in the top left corner.  Do not hesitate to send me an email if you want to give me feedback (just click on the red envelope in the top right corner) or tweet me [@brodriguesco](https://twitter.com/brodriguesco).
