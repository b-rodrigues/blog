I'm currently writing a book as a hobby. It's titled *Functional programming and
unit testing for data munging with R* and you can get it for free
[here](https://leanpub.com/fput/). You can also read it online for free on my
[webpage](http://www.brodrigues.co/fput) What's the book about?

Here's the teaser text:

>Learn the basics of functional programming, unit testing and package development for the R programming language in order to make your data tidy!

The book now has a beautiful cover thanks to
[@putosaure](https://twitter.com/putosaure). Putosaure is a Paris based graphic
designer who also reviews video games. He is also a very good friend of mine and
I am very happy he made this beautiful cover for my book:

In it, we see a guy holding a shield with the Greek letter lambda, which also happens to be the letter to designate functional programming. I've added the title with the [Komika Title](http://www.dafont.com/komika-title.font) font.

Consider this cover in beta, it'll probably evolve some more. But I couldn't wait to use it!

I love it. Hope you'll love it too!
